title Enrollment

left header
ICAPPR patients are enrolled through a CommCare application called Enrich Ethiopia
(https://www.commcarehq.org/a/enrich-ethiopia-copy/).

Enrich Ethiopia defines a Registration form, where health care workers can enter
patient enrollment data, including a patient's language <i>(L)</i> and preferred call time of day <i>(T)</i>.
CommCare forwards new forms to the ICAPPR Motech server using the CommCare "stub form" feed.
